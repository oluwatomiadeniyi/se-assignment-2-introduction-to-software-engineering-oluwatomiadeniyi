Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, each serving a specific purpose in the development process:

Requirement Analysis: In this phase, stakeholders' needs and requirements are gathered and analyzed to understand what the software should accomplish. This involves communication with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to define project goals, scope, and functionalities.

Design: Once requirements are gathered, the design phase involves creating a blueprint for the software system. This includes architectural design, defining data structures, algorithms, user interfaces, and other technical specifications necessary to implement the software solution.

Implementation (Coding): This phase involves the actual coding or programming of the software based on the design specifications. Developers write code according to established coding standards, using appropriate programming languages and tools.

Testing: In the testing phase, the software is rigorously tested to identify and fix defects or bugs. Various testing techniques such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing are employed to ensure the software meets quality standards and behaves as expected.

Deployment (or Installation): Once the software passes testing and is deemed ready for release, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase involves installing the software on end-users' systems or servers and making it available for use.

Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored, updated, and modified to address any issues that arise or to incorporate new features and enhancements. Maintenance may include bug fixes, performance optimizations, security updates, and compatibility adjustments.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The Agile and Waterfall models are two prominent methodologies used in software development, each with its own approach and characteristics:

Waterfall Model:
